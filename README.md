# Adjusters Portal
Angular Application for Portfolio


Web Application designed to benefit the Adjuster in planning and routing their stops for the day. The user can select a date from the calendar, and, using mat-tab-group, the application will automatically pane to the next tab.
This tab contains the claims available to route for the day. From this window, the user will select the claims they want to route. On the final tab, the data points are sent to Google via Google Geolocation and Routing APIs, then plotted to a Angular Google Map. On the other side, an Angular Material Drag and Drop is utlized so that the user may change the automatic routing if they wish. Finally, this page may be printed, or sent to a live Google map, allowing for added stops, more features, and a more robust map. 

The skills utilized for this project are, but not limited to: Angular 7, Angular Google Maps API, Google Geolocation API, Google Routing API, Angular Material, Typescript, HTML, CSS and The Marker-Clusterer Library.
